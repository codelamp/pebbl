## Pebbl (v0.5)

### Overview

Pebbl has been in partial existence now since around 2007. It was initially an experiment for me to learn how to interact with Canvas, which has since led me on a merry journey across time, space, death and reality... well — more accurately — across a wide range of technologies. In fact, if it wasn't for this project, I wouldn't know half the things I know about front-end implementations.

Things that have been attempted for Pebbl:

- Multiple bespoke canvas renderer versions
- DHTML version
- Unity version

### For now

This version makes use of Matter.js. Mainly because I wanted to try it out as a physics engine, with an aim to couple its rendering via Pixi.js. For now we are using Matter's default renderer which still does most of what we need.
