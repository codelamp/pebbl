## Pebbl (v0.4)

### Overview

Pebbl has been in partial existence now since around 2007. It was initially an experiment for me to learn how to interact with Canvas, which has since led me on a merry journey across time, space, death and reality... well — more accurately — across a wide range of technologies. In fact, if it wasn't for this project, I wouldn't know half the things I know about front-end implementations.

### For now

Currently this repo is going to house the most up-to-date versions of both my Theory library, Async and Polycade libraries. I will eventually split these off into their own repos again. For now, in order to build each sub "repo", please run the following in the main repo folder:

    npm install
    npm run build

The above will also need gulp to be installed globally.

The above link is just testing the loader capability, and loading the hit areas.
